# Anime scraping
## Prerequisites
You'll need python 3 in order to run the project.
To install the dependencies, run (preferably in a virtual environment, [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)'s a link on how and why to create one):
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Virtual env crash course
```sh
pip install virtualenv # Installing the virtualenv package if necessary
python -m venv <virtualenv-name> # Creating a virtual environment
source <virtualenv-name>/bin/activate # Activating the virtual environment
deactivate # Deactivating the virtual environment
```
## How to run
```
python3 app.py
```
